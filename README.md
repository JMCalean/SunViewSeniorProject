# SunViewSeniorProject

Current problems:

Logout button: With the addition of the HtmlPage.html, users will not be directed to temp.html anymore (which is where the logout button is).
When this project is deployed to the web, the XML document is not being read so the UI will not work. The project will still work if you are running with in Visual Studios.
